//? STACK TRACE AND CALL STACK
// stack trace tells you in what order functions were called
// first thing in the call stack is the most recent function that was called
// works backwards from inside to outside
// first definition is the most inside function where error occured
// last thing is the outer most function

// good for error tracking and tracing
